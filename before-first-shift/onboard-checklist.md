Once you're on the organizations page you will first need to remove the TC from Learn Verified.

From the organizations page make sure that you have `v-000` selected underneath `Learn Verified` on the left side bar:

On this same page we need to add the new TC to the Teaching Assistants. This will give them access to expert chat. On the right side bar scroll down until you see `+ Teaching Assistants`. Click this button and either type in the TC's name or email(they should come up) and then click `Add` - **be sure that you have added the correct person!**:

Now we can add the TC to the Technical Coach Training Track! On the same page select `Curriculum (Internal)` and make sure `learn-expers-testing-batch` is highlighted:
