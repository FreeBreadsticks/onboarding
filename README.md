General Notes
Learn Expert track should be rewritten to include update material
Needs to be more structured like a curriculum track, instead of an information dump
Modules indicated by time frame ( Before shift, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3)?
Create handbook for new TCs for them to easily refer to - or is this the curriculum track?
Expand onboarding checklist for TCLs so nothing falls through the cracks while onboarding new TCLs
Possibly send out a form asking current TCs what they wished they knew when starting
Notes from 7/3
Shadows before their first roleplay
Standardize roleplaying process
Preselect labs criteria for evaluation
JS - Online shopping lab
Ruby - ttt: game status, move, won? Method
Rails - amusement park
Sinatra - remove the rack override over the config.ru
Focus on socratic method 
Focus on  teaching mode
Focus on debugging?
How is the TC interview conducted?**
How to input hours through OneLogin/WeWork
