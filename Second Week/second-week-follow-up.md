## Slack Check-Ins

Similar to week one, you will want to check in with the new TC. At this point they should have a pretty solid grasp on how to handle a shift while in sync. Make sure the TC is still feeling positive and confident with their shifts and schedule. 

You may want to ask them about their schedule, if they know how to request time off, set their preferences etc.. Also double check that they are submitting their time in Workday correctly. 

## Peer Observations

If you have not spoken with them about peer observations yet, be sure to do so now. Let the TC know that these observations are meant to enhance their own skill by observing their fellow TCs. Make sure that you give them the link to the [observation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOIlOz585-yyF2PhWzpZykipKV4CrqvD1STZLilhhTdvSrLw/viewform). Go over the form and explain that they are only required to submit a "Glow" but are welcome to grade and give an action item! 


## Dispatch Guide

Prior to the new TC shadowing you, you will want to go over the basics of dispatch in a zoom meeting. Be sure to share your screen (or have them share theirs) and go over the interface. Explain to them the importance of:
 - Requires Action, Active Questions, and Inactive Questions
 - Responding to students quickly and positively
 - Retrieving the error and code from students
 - Assigning questions
 - Resolving old questions
