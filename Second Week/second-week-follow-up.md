## Slack Check-Ins

Similar to week one, you will want to check in with the new TC. At this point they should have a pretty solid grasp on how to handle a shift while in sync. Make sure the TC is still feeling positive and confident with their shifts and schedule. 

You may want to ask them about their schedule, if they know how to request time off, set their preferences etc.. Also double check that they are submitting their time in Workday correctly. 

## Peer Observations

If you have not spoken with them about peer observations yet, be sure to do so now. Let the TC know that these observations are meant to enhance their own skill by observing their fellow TCs. Make sure that you give them the link to the [observation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOIlOz585-yyF2PhWzpZykipKV4CrqvD1STZLilhhTdvSrLw/viewform). Go over the form and explain that they are only required to submit a "Glow" but are welcome to grade and give an action item! 


## Dispatch Guide

Prior to the new TC shadowing you, you will want to go over the basics of dispatch in a zoom meeting. Be sure to share your screen (or have them share theirs) and go over the interface. Explain to them the importance of:

 - Requires Action, Active Questions, and Inactive Questions
 - Responding to students quickly and positively
 - Retrieving the error and code from students
 - Assigning questions
 - Resolving old questions


## Dispatch Shadow Session

After going over the basics of dispatch you will want to have the TC shadow you on dispatch for about 15 minutes. Have them join a zoom session and then share your screen as you work. If possible, narrate your actions and your thought process. Make sure to tell them about any best practices or tips/tricks you use while working dispatch. Once the 15 minutes has concluded open up the meeting to a question and answer period to go over anything they need.

## Submit a JIRA Ticket

If at all possible have the new TC submit a JIRA ticket while a TCL or seasoned TC shadows them. If there's not a ticket to be submitted you may want to shadow them on a mock ticket submission. Have them prepare a ticket as if they were to submit one, but don't actually submit it! This way the TC can still have some exposure and practice for when they really have to do it.
