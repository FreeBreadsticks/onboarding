# Dispatch Best Practices

If this is the first shift of the day, the coaches that are currently on will need to decide which of them will be working dispatch (normally a more seasoned coach will take this role). If you are taking dispatch you will need to `qbot in dispatch` in the #technical-coaches channel. Remember, that you need to make sure you have another coach standing by to take dispatch once your shift has ended.

## What Even is a Dispatch?

Dispatch can seem overwhelming at first. There's a lot going on and an endless supply of students needing help! The dispatcher acts as the gatekeeper between the students and the TC's that are in sync. It is the dispatcher's job to keep things organized and to make sure that each student is attended to. It can seem intense when there are many active questions but stay calm and remember that you've got a whole team of people who are ready to help! As with anything, the more you do it, the better you will get.

## The Interface

Let's take a look at some of the expert-chat basics:

1. `Requires Action`: This is where all of the incoming questions initially show up. Questions will also be moved into this section when they have been waiting for a response from a tech coach for more than 15 minutes. The questions that pop up here take priority. Greet students quickly! They will appreciate your prompt response.

2. `Active Questions`: This section contains the students that you are actively chatting with. Play close attention to the blue circles that appear over the student's profile picture. The number in the blue circle tells you how many messages they have sent without being responded too. Try to keep these questions completely clear of the blue by responding to students quickly and effectively. 

3. `Inactive Questions`: This section contains students that have not responded to a coach in over 15 minutes. It's a good idea to check these questions occasionally if it is slow to make sure that no student is waiting for a response or screen share from a tech coach! You will also want to resolve questions that have been inactive for over 8-10 hours. 

4. `Student and Lab Information`: This is arguably one of the most informative pieces of the expert chat UI. It is here where you can see how many questions the student has asked in total as well as how many notes are taken. You can also find the lab name, link, and how many issues are currently raised on the lab. (I will go into greater detail later in this guide)

5. `Chat Bar, Resolve Button, and Enrollments Button`: As you might have guessed, this is where you will message the student. You can also find the button to resolve the question as well as the button to assign the question to admissions. 


## Dispatch Goals

When you are working dispatch you are the first person a student will encounter and first impressions **definitely** count. It is your job to ensure that the student starts out on the right foot. Even though it may seem like you will only be chatting with a student for just a few minutes you have the power to make or break a session. 

As the dispatcher, you also have a large influence on how a shift in general will play out. If you queue everything up without trying to solve easier issues over chat you will likely cause a long queue and wear out your fellow TCs. A good dispatcher can strike a balance by handling easier issues via chat and sending more complicated ones to screen shares.

Try to keep these goals in mind as you make your way through a dispatch shift:

1. **Express Kindness and Be Engaged:**
Always greet the student quickly and with a smile. Instead of diving straight into the issue first ask the student "How are you today? :)"

2. **Decipher the Issue:**
Have the student send you their code along with the error. Use your judgement and decide wether this student is best suited in a screen share or if it's something you can handle over chat.

3. **Monitor TC Screen Share Times:** 
If it's busy you will want to make sure the TC's in sync are staying within the 20 minute range. Use `qbot who is on?` to show you who is on a screen share and for how long. If they're at the limit ping them to let them know! (You could do something like @thanos :timer: in Slack!)

4. **Support Your Fellow TCs:**
Occasionally some truly exceptionally issues will come up. You normally will be able to tell quickly if an issue is severe if you've gathered enough information in chat. In these cases a TC might be in a long screen share for a reason. Direct message the TC and ask them if everything is going ok or if they need help. Offer assistance if you are able to, help esclate if necessary, or have another TC join them if possible and necessary.

5. **Offering Resources:**
In AAQ we are only supposed to help with issues related to the lab work. Sometimes there will be questions you can't support. If the student is asking about requirements, tuition, or anyting else about the course like that you will want to assign the question to admissions. If they're asking for help on a portfolio project you will want to direct them to 1:1 support.
