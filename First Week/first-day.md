## Day one of training

1. Give details about qbot. About the specific qbot commands, such as qbot in sync, qbot in dispatch (which of course they won’t start out as), qbot out at the end of the day, qbot done for finishing a screen share, and qbot unresponsive as well the guidelines for when to use it, and when to qbot done the unresponsive question.

Qbot commands to go over:
```
qbot in sync - logs in TC as sync support
qbot in dispatch - logs in TC as dispatch support
qbot out - signs out TC
qbot queue <link> - adds question to Q (dispatch only)
qbot take <link> - assigns question to the TC using this command.
qbot unresponsive - If student hasn't responded within 5 minutes, type this in chat to place them back in queue for sleep and send them a message like 'Let us know when you get back!', it was give it to the next TC after 5 minutes. If there is no response, this will be done again and repeated until the student responds or it's been 30 minutes, to where you will qbot done the question.
qbot q - shows a list of all the students in q
qbot who is on? - shows a list of tc's, if they are paired, and how long they've been paired.
```

2. Start out with three roleplay screen shares where you are the student and they are TC (give feedback).

3. Start out with three screen shares letting them shadow you and see your process.

4. Go over any details of the process you take after each screen share to make sure they understand the process.

5. Have the shadower do 3 screen shares while you observe, giving hints in slack if you feel they are lost. If they are unable to figure it out feel free to jump in and help (but only as a last resort). Give feedback after each screen share.

6. After the third screen share you observe. Have them do one on their own without you in the screen share. Let them know if they need help, to tell the student “Let me get another technical coach to assist us with this issue” and give you the link to their screen share so you can join.

7. Once they complete their first screen share on their own successfully. See how they feel about the process and if they are ready to go on their own. Also let them know as colleagues, we’ll be there to help support and to feel free to reach out to us if they get stuck.

8. If they don’t feel like they are ready just yet, let them do one more on their own without you being in the screen share, but acting as a backup. With the same guidelines (see 7 for details).

9. Let them know they are ready to start screen shares and wish them the best of luck and remind them they have the other technical coaches as support.

10. At the end of the day, make sure they qbot out and fill out the end of the day survey(might pair with them in zoom to oversee it)!
