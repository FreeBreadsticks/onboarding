# First Week Follow Up

- [ ] Slack Check-ins
- [ ] 1 Observation and Feedback Session
- [ ] JIRA Ticket Intro


## Slack Check-Ins

It is important to follow up on the status of the new TC(s) as they make their way through their first week. If there is more than one onboarding at the same time, you should open a group chat on Slack. It's likely they will all come across the same issues so to avoid repeating yourself you can encourage them to post the questions there. This will also help foster a sense of community and support early on. 

Make sure to ask them how they're feeling and if there's anything that they are confused about. Take the time to address any issues they may have or offer them a screen share if there is something in particular that they'd like to know how to do (such as searching for solutions in the tc_support channel).

## Observation and Feedback

During this first week you will want to shadow them again at some point. Use this session to confirm that they are doing well and have a firm grasp on how to handle a screen share and the socratic method. Make sure to keep notes using the same document you created initially. 

Have the other TCL who is working on onboarding shadow the new TC as well. At some point both TCLs should meet to discuss if things are going well and if not, what steps need to be taken to address the issues. 

If there are issues or misconceptions, you can have the new TC focus on specific sections of the training course. Or if you feel they are lacking technically, have them go through some labs in the section you feel they were weak on. If it's necessary, you may want to conduct a 4th mock pairing session.

## JIRA Ticket Introduction

You will also want to introduce submitting a ticket using JIRA at some point in the first week. Briefly describe the process and how it works. Make sure that they have access to these resources:
- [Issue Priority Definitions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yr-CsT0hIfSEcz9vv9yjkRGWQLeKmG40SNjywphoOc/edit#gid=0)
- [How to Create Good JIRA Tickets](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/technical-coach-resources/blob/master/jira-tickets.md)
- [TODO: Video on Submitting JIRA Ticket](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/technical-coach-resources/blob/master/jira-tickets.md)


 Be sure to answer any questions the TC may have regarding JIRA tickets. If possible have the new TCF shadow a seasoned TC submitting a ticket that way they can see the process.
