# New TC Cheat Sheet

## Qbot Commands
- `qbot in sync` - logs in TC as sync support
- `qbot in dispatch` - logs in TC as dispatch support(will most likely not need this until later)
- `qbot out` - signs out TC
- `qbot queue <link>` - adds question to Q (dispatch only)
- `qbot take <link>` - assigns question to the TC using this command.
- `qbot unresponsive` - If student hasn't responded within 5 minutes, type this in chat to place them back in queue for sleep and send them a message like 'Let us know when you get back!', it was give it to the next TC after 5 minutes. If there is no response, this will be done again and repeated until the student responds or it's been 30 minutes, to where you will qbot done the question.
- `qbot q` - shows a list of all the students in q
- `qbot done` - marks the question as completed (what you will do if you’ve solved the students issue)
- `qbot more help` - if you are struggling to help solve the student’s issue or you are over on time, this will assign the question to the next TC in line
- `qbot who is on?` - shows a list of tc's, if they are paired, and how long they've been paired

## Hours/Time
- Put hours into workday (access through onelogin) by EOD Saturday to get time into your paycheck
- Do not swap or take a shift that would cause you to have over 29 hours for a week (Sunday - Saturday) without checking first with Ruth
- Meeting with Squad, with Ruth or with TCL are payable time.  Include the time on workday.

## Shift Tips
- If you are going to be late be sure to let the people on shift know (if possible)
- If you are assigned a screen share 5 min before you shift ends, feel free to `qbot more help` 
- If you are unsure of an issue, `@here` the channel to see if any other TC might be able to help you with it, you can qbot more help if you still feel stuck
- Watch your time - try your best to keep your screen shares in the **20 minute time range**
- Use annotations! In zoom, at the top of the screen, there’s a drop down with options - select `annotate` and you can can add lines / arrows to the screen - help to focus the student’s attention
- If you want to run qbot commands(ones that aren’t qbot take or qbot done) - you can dm them directly to qbot, this helps keep the main chat clear (for example: if you wanted to run `qbot who is on?`)
